<h4><a href="http://www.meetup.com/ClevelandRuby/">Cleveland Ruby Brigade</a></h4>
<p>I've been organizing this group in Cleveland since October 2012. We we meet once a month on the first Thursday.  In the past we've had guest speakers, 'hack nights,' and simply watched pre-recorded conference talks.  We also have a special format to our meetings which allows newcomers a chance to come and learn while still giving the regulars a chance to learn something new.</p>

<h4><a href="http://globalday.coderetreat.org/">Global Day of Code Retreat</a></h4>
<p>This is a day when software craftsman get together on the weekend to practice some crazy tricks with code.  It is always great fun and a good chance to meet new developers near you.  Software developers of all backgrounds and proficiency with any language are welcome.  I've participated in a number of these and helped to host the in Cleveland for 2012. I've also started planning for 2013 and am planning to help organize this year's as well.</p>

<h4><a href="http://pghtechfest.com/">Pittsburgh TechFest 2013</a></h4>
<p>I was honored to speak in Pittsburgh this year, this was my first experience speaking at a conference.  I've attended this one before so I had a good idea what to expect from the audience.  I spoke on a ruby gem named Ruboto which allows you to develop Android applications using the ruby programming language.</p>

<h4><a href="http://www.codemash.org/">Codemash 2.0.1.4</a></h4>
<p>I've recently been accepted to speak in January at the upcoming Codemash conference.  This is a fantastic conference held at the Kalihari resort in the middle of winter.  Where else can you wear shorts and go swimming in Ohio in the dead of winter?  I've been accepted for two sessions, one will discuss the Travis-CI service for open source applicaitons, while the other will be about how to do some thing that an IDE does for you without the added overhead of an actual IDE.</p>
